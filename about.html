  <h3>Laser inscription process</h3>
  <p>The lasr inscription process is quite unique. It is quite different from conventional microfabrication techniques such as lithography or self assembly. In these rocesses a "top down" or "bottom up" approach is used. Instead, in the case of the laser inscription process, a laser is focused inside a transparent material and in the case of ultrashort pulses nonlinear processes result in multiphoton absorption localised at a laser focus. Hence, this method is best described as "inside-out" and is a substantial departure from conventional fabrication techniques. 

This technology is not just a curiousity, it is now a commercial reality. <a href="http://www.translume.com/">Translume</a> fabricate microfluidic circuits and is based in the USA. <a href="http://www.optoscribe.com/">Optoscribe</a> is a UK based company which seeks to exploit the inherent 3D capability of the proces to produce telecommunications products. <a href="http://www.femtoprint.ch/">Femtoprint</a>, a Swiss company, is the latest to enter the fray and go one step further; this group will develop ANYTHING you want as well as sell you an entire fabrication system. The product range spans microflexures, microfluidics, photonic elements and more.</p>
