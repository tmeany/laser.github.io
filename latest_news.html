<h3><b>27/07/2015</b> <a href="http://openplant.org/event-directory/open-technology-week/">Open Plant fund pitches</a></h3>
<p>
Fascinating talks by pitchers seeking access to the Open PLant funding initiative.

<h3><b>26/07/2015</b> <a href="http://openplant.org/event-directory/open-technology-week/">Open Technology Workshop</a></h3>
<p>
WOW! This event was focused on open technologies and in particular hardware technoloy. Speakers were exciting, passionate and of an exceptional standard. Javier Serrano talked about open technologies developed by CERN and touched on the potential for open source as a funding model since it dodges the issue of "vendor lock in". Robert Mullins from the computing dept. talked about <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/">lowRISC</a> which is a new low level silicon prototyping technique. Tom Baden spoke about the <a href="https://tombaden.wordpress.com/tinkering/">TReND</a> project with an amazing demo of a £100 microscope! Awesome potential.

<h3><b>21/07/2015</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lpor.v9.4/issuetoc">New review of quantum applications published in Laser & Photonics Reviews</a></h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/280235497_Laser_written_circuits_for_quantum_photonics">Get it here.</a>This review focuses on the use of laser inscribed circuits for quantum information applications. It introduces both the fields of laser inscription and quantum optics, making it the ideal introduction for anyone who is entering the field of integrated quantum circuits. It is the result of a fantastic international collaboration between researchers from Macquarie University, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena and Toshibas Cambridge Research Labs. This work was supported by funding from the PICQUE network.

<h3><b>06/07/2015</b> <a href="http://www.picque.eu/romaschool2015/">PICQUE Roma Scientific School 2015</a></h3>
<p>
This event  focused on "integrated quantum photonics applications:
from simulation to sensing" with a strong emphasis on the use of laser inscribed circuits. Talks were given by world leaders in the laser inscription field <a href="https://www.fisi.polimi.it/en/people/osellame">Roberto Osellame</a> and <a href="http://www.iap.uni-jena.de/Ultrafast+Optics/People-p-53.html">Alexander Szameit</a>. Another amazing feature of this event were workshops given by experts which ran over the course of two days including from Seth Loyd. Gregory Ribordy, CEO of ID Quantique also gave a super talk about his groups work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution">quantum key distribution (QKD)</a>. As an emplyee of Toshiba I reminded Dr. Ribordy of the world leading position of Toshiba in the area of QKD using "live fibre" or non-dedicated fibre systems for distributing the secret keys!

<h3><b>01/07/2015</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00256">New hybrid integration results from Toshiba Cambridge Labs</a></h3>
<p>
Check out our new paper on hybrid integration between waveguide circuits and InAs quantum dots. This work was supported by funding from the PICQUE network.

<h3><b>26/06/2015</b> <a href="http://tvc2015.cutec.org/">TVC 2015: Future Resource Abundance</a></h3>
<p>
This event brought together scientist, entrepreneurs, investors and more. It was a great opportunity to learn from lectures, workshops and live demos. I was delighted to host the session on Materials and Manufacturing with talks from Jose Pacheco, Chris Twinn and Guillaume Baxter with a fantastic keynote from Rudy De Waele. It was followed by an amazing dinner in Trinity Hall. In keeping with the "sustainable futures" theme I found out that the solid oak flooring of the dinning room in Trinity Hall was in fact replaced using a stand of oak planted for just that eventuallity about 200 years ago.. My word if only we thought that far ahead now!
